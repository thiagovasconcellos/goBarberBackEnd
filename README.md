## Getting started

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with nodemon.
This allows you to change something on the project and it instatly affects on how server works.

## How it works

Please notice that this project was developed for study purposes only.
In order to try things out, you should download this project and start the server on your machine.
Then have a look to the swagger [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/thiagovasconcellos/GoBarber/1.0#)

Basically you can sign up to the application as a provider or a user. Them you can register your Barber (if you're a provider) and receive users appointments.

This project will also cover a front-end app for providers and a mobile app for users. Coming up soon!
